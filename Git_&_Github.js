A version control system lets you track your changes to the source code.

Git: version control system for tracking changes in code $ collab with others
     - serves as a central point for collaboration with a focus on agile methodologies

Github: Is an online hosting platform for Git repositories $ collaborate with others, share code, and manage projects.

Git supports featured branching

What is so special about Git? /Features of git repository model
1: tracks source code
2: provides a distributed version control system - you can revert changes

Git and Github : Basic terms

SSH protocol: Method to secure remote login

Repository: a data structure for storing docs including source codes
          :  contains project folders
          : a repo can track & maintain version control

Fork: copy of a repository

Pull request: to request for review and approval of changes

Working directory: contains files and subdirectories

commit: snapshot of the projects current state along with description of changes made

Branch: Separate line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes independently

Merge: Combining changes from one branch into another

Clone: Local copy of the remote repository

Gitlab: A DevOps platform that:
   - supports CI/CD pipelines & streamline testing
   - provides access to git repositories
   - allows devs to collaborate
   -enables devs to work from a local copy
   -enables devs to branch and merge code

Distributed version control system (DVCS): A system that keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored.

Continuous delivery (CD): The automated movement of software through the software development lifecycle.

Continuous integration (CI): The process of automatically building and testing code to ensure it is working correctly.

   Github Branches

Branches store all files in github
Main branch store the deployable code
Create a new branch for planned changes/ to develop new features

Commit best practices:
-Do not end commit message with a period
-use less than 50 characters

Pull Requests
- makes the proposed/committed changes available for others to review and use
-Github auto makes a pull request if you make a change on a branch you dont own
- A pull request is a way to notify other team members of the changes and edits made to the main branch.

What is the purpose of a license?
-To express how people can use your code

What happens if you make a change on a repository branch that you don't own?
- GitHub generates an error message.
